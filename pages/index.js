          <p>
            WordPress is often overlooked as a content management system by
            ‚Äúmodern developers‚Äù.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think this is a painful oversight. There is no more affordable,
            flexible and powerful CMS - particularly for statically built sites.

            Next.js is an amazing framework built on top of React. I spend time
            making tutorials and content exploring how to use it in interesting
            ways.
