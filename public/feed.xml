            <description><![CDATA[So, this has been a wild ride through React. We&#8217;ve gone deep into the library and touched on so many different aspects of workflow, technical points and general community exposure. This has all been happening while lockdown has ramped up. That has made it look pretty strange &#8211; I&#8217;ve been doing these for several evenings [&hellip;]
